## Data Structures and Algorithms Reflection

In this course, I focused on building and analyzing data structures that make software more efficient and scalable. The main problem I solved across both projects was figuring out how to organize and access data quickly, specifically managing and displaying Computer Science courses in a way that balanced runtime performance and memory use.

**Project One** involved analyzing the efficiency of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees.  
**Project Two** applied those findings by implementing a working program that reads course data from a file and outputs it in alphanumeric order.

What made this project valuable was learning why data structures matter so much in real-world development. Each choice, whether to use a hash table for constant-time lookups or a vector for sequential access, has a measurable impact on performance and user experience. I encountered a few challenges along the way, especially when debugging file-parsing errors and ensuring the output stayed sorted correctly, but breaking down the logic step by step and validating each function helped me overcome them.

Working through these projects changed how I think about designing software. I now approach every problem with scalability and clarity in mind. My code has become more modular, more readable, and easier to maintain because I have learned to structure it around data flow rather than simply getting the program to work. This course helped me connect theory to practice by taking concepts like runtime analysis and turning them into design habits I can carry into larger software engineering projects.
